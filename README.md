# Door Lock Security System

The Door Lock Security System acts as a Smart Door Lock with the help of multiple peripheral devices connected to an Arduino Uno. A special Solenoid Lock is used to keep the door secure. The door unlocks and locks only when the RFID reader detects the appropriate keycard. A buzzer paired with an ultrasonic sensor gives out an alert based on the card ID and proximity of the user.
